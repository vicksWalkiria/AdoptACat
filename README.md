## Getting Started

This is the Android part of the tutorial. To complete the working example you'll have to download the Database and the API/Rest from this github account. 
I've just uploaded the API and DB to my server, in the app, in AppData class, change line 37 to this:

public static final String ROOT_URL = "https://adoptacat.walkiriaapps.com/";

And you will be good to go.
